# Calico
Calico is a Kubernetes CNI (Container Networking Interface). It provides a scalable, secure, and high-performance networking infrastructure. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to install Calico Open Source on an existing Kubernetes Cluster. There's two other product, Calico Enterprise and Calico Cloud. See Tigera product comparison [here](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/about/product-comparison)

|Policy|IPAM|CNI|Overlay|Routing|Datastore|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|Calico|Calico|Calico|VxLAN|Calico|Kubernetes|

## Prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster up and running
- SSH access to a Master Node
- `kubectl` installed
- Internet access to download Calico's manifest file

# Install Calico Open Source
Get the latest version number of `calico`:
```sh
VER=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/projectcalico/calico/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4|sed 's/v//g')
echo $VER
```

Download Tigera Calico operator and custom resource definitions manifest:
```sh
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v${VER}/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v${VER}/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
```

Install Tigera Calico operator and custom resource definitions:
```sh
kubectl create -f tigera-operator.yaml
```

> **Note**
>As per Calico, due to the large size of the CRD bundle, `kubectl apply` might exceed request limits. Instead, use `kubectl create ...`.

# Install Calico custom resource definitions
You need to install Tigera Calico custom resource definitions, but before, make sure the `cidr` value matches the one you passed to `kubeadm init ...` when you bootstrapped your K8s cluster. See below my `custom-resources.yaml` file that I edited:

To retreive the `cidr` value you passed to `kubeadm init ...` when you bootstrapped you K8s cluster, type the command:
```sh
CIDR=$(kubectl cluster-info dump | grep -m 1 cluster-cidr | tr -d ' ,"' | cut -d "=" -f 2)
echo $CIDR
```

You should see the following output (your milage may vary 😀). That's the value that you need to edit in the file `custom-resources.yaml`:
```
100.64.0.0/10
```

Relace the default value `cidr: 192.168.0.0/16` for `cidr: 100.64.0.0/10` in the file `custom-resources.yaml`.

```sh
sed -i "s|^\([[:space:]]*\)cidr:.*$|\1cidr: $CIDR|" custom-resources.yaml
```
> [!WARNING]  
> **Make sure you enter the exact same value. If you make a typo, Calico won't install.**

Create the custom resource definitions:
```sh
kubectl create -f custom-resources.yaml
```

Confirm that the operator pod is running with the following command:
```sh
kubectl get pods -n tigera-operator
```

You should see the following output:
```
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
tigera-operator-58f95869d6-d6m2f   1/1     Running   0          30m
```

Confirm that all of the pods are running with the following command:
```sh
watch -n 1 "kubectl get pods -n calico-system && kubectl get pods -n calico-apiserver"
```

>Be patient here, K8s needs to downloads the images on Internet. It took me 10 minutes to have all the Pods running. You can use Ctrl+C to exit from the watch command once all of the Calico pods are in `Running` Status.

You should see the following output when everything in downloaded and running:
```

# Validation
From here we can see that there are different pods that are deployed.
- `calico-node`: Calico-node runs on every Kubernetes cluster node as a DaemonSet. It is responsible for enforcing network policy, setting up routes on the nodes, plus managing any virtual interfaces for IPIP, VXLAN, or WireGuard.
- `calico-typha`: Typha is as a stateful proxy for the Kubernetes API server. It's used by every calico-node pod to query and watch Kubernetes resources without putting excessive load on the Kubernetes API server.  The Tigera Operator automatically scales the number of Typha instances as the cluster size grows.
- `calico-kube-controllers`: Runs a variety of Calico specific controllers that automate synchronization of resources. For example, when a Kubernetes node is deleted, it tidies up any IP addresses or other Calico resources associated with the node.

## Validating the Calico installation
Following the configuration of the installation resource, Calico will begin deploying onto your cluster. This can be validated by running the following command:
```sh
kubectl get tigerastatus/calico
```

The output from the command when the installation is complete is:
```
NAME     AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE
calico   True        False         False      47m
```

If Calico is installed, all your nodes should be in `Ready` state. Reviewing Node Health with the following command:
```sh
kubectl get nodes -o=wide
```

You should see the following output:
```
NAME                     STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION   INTERNAL-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION         CONTAINER-RUNTIME
k8smaster1.isociel.com   Ready    control-plane   9m5s   v1.27.3   192.168.13.61   <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS   6.4.3-060403-generic   containerd://1.6.21
k8smaster2.isociel.com   Ready    control-plane   7m9s   v1.27.3   192.168.13.62   <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS   6.4.3-060403-generic   containerd://1.6.21
```

Now we can see that our Kubernetes nodes have a status of `Ready` and are operational. Calico is now installed on your cluster.

# Install `calicoctl` as a binary and as a `kubectl` plugin on a single host
Use the following command to download the `calicoctl` binary file:
```sh
curl -L https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/releases/latest/download/calicoctl-linux-amd64 -o calicoctl
```

Set the file to be executable, set owner and move it to `/usr/local/bin/`:
```sh
chmod +x ./calicoctl
sudo mv calicoctl /usr/local/bin
sudo chown root:adm /usr/local/bin/calicoctl
```

To be able to use it as a `kubectl` plugin, just symlink it to the binary you just installed:
```sh
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/calicoctl /usr/local/bin/kubectl-calico
sudo chown root:adm /usr/local/bin/kubectl-calico
```

Verify the plugin works:
```sh
kubectl calico -h
```

You can now run any `calicoctl` subcommands through `kubectl calico`.

You should be able to use it:
```sh
calicoctl version
```

You should see the following output:
```
Client Version:    v3.26.0
Git commit:        8b103f46f
Cluster Version:   v3.26.0
Cluster Type:      typha,kdd,k8s,operator,bgp,kubeadm
```

## `calicoctl` with `sudo`
If you use sudo for commands, remember that your environment variables are not transferred to the sudo environment. You must run sudo with the `-E` flag to include your environment variables:

```sh
sudo -E calicoctl node diags
```

# Verify Calico API server
You should see the API server pod become ready, and Calico API resources become available. You can check whether the APIs are available with the following command:
```sh
kubectl api-resources | grep '\sprojectcalico.org'
```

You should see the following output:
```

You can use `kubectl` to interact with the Calico APIs. For example, you can view IP pools with the command:
```sh
kubectl get ippools
```
You should see output that looks like this:
```
NAME                  CREATED AT
default-ipv4-ippool   2023-07-18T20:20:32Z
```

## Reference
[Calico API Server](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/operations/install-apiserver)

# Tests with `calicoctl`
The `calicoctl` command line interface provides a number of resource management commands to allow you to create, modify, delete, and view the different Calico resources. This section is a command line reference for `calicoctl`, organized based on the command hierarchy.

The full list of resources that can be managed, including a description of each, is described in the [Resource definitions](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/reference/resources/overview) section.

The next command needs to be run locally on a master node:
```sh
sudo kubectl calico node status
```

You should see output that looks like this:
```
Calico process is running.

# Create Host Endpoints
Let's now create the Host Endpoints, allowing Calico to start policy enforcement on **node** interfaces. If Calico can't create the `Host Endpoints`, the Global Network Policy won't be enforced.

First, verify there no existing Host Endpoints:
```sh
daniel@k8smaster1 ~ $ calicoctl get heps
```

Example output:
```sh
NAME   NODE
```

Now let's configure Calico to automatically create Host Endpoints for Kubernetes nodes:
```sh
daniel@k8smaster1 ~ $ calicoctl patch kubecontrollersconfiguration default --patch='{"spec": {"controllers": {"node": {"hostEndpoint": {"autoCreate": "Enabled"}}}}}'
Successfully patched 1 'KubeControllersConfiguration' resource
```

Example output:
```sh
daniel@k8smaster1 ~ $ calicoctl get heps
NAME                              NODE                     
k8smaster1.isociel.com-auto-hep   k8smaster1.isociel.com   
k8sworker1.isociel.com-auto-hep   k8sworker1.isociel.com   
k8sworker2.isociel.com-auto-hep   k8sworker2.isociel.com   
k8sworker3.isociel.com-auto-hep   k8sworker3.isociel.com   
```

# Get Calico version
To find the Calico version that is being used, run the following command:
```sh
calicoctl version
```

You should see output that looks like this:
```
Client Version:    v3.26.0
Git commit:        8b103f46f
Cluster Version:   v3.26.0
Cluster Type:      typha,kdd,k8s,operator,bgp,kubeadm
```


Or run this command if not running `calicoctl`:
```sh
kubectl get clusterinfo -o yaml
