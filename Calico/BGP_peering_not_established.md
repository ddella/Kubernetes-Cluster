# BGP peering not established
After checking the BGP peering with Calico, I found that the nodes hadn't established a BGP connection. See the output of the command `sudo kubectl calico node status` below:

The `INFO` column should be `Established`:
```
Calico process is running.

IPv4 BGP status

+---------------+-------------------+-------+----------+-------------+

IPv6 BGP status
No IPv6 peers found.
```

>We see that BGP sessions have a status of `Connect` which is not established.

## Check Calico nodes logs
Check the Calico node logs for any BGP errors:
```sh
kubectl get pods -n calico-system
```

The output will look like this:
```

    ```sh
    kubectl logs -n calico-system calico-node-gw7h4 | grep -i BIRD
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    [...]
    bird: Mesh_10_4_0_1: State changed to start
    2023-06-22 11:25:26.414 [INFO][81] confd/resource.go 277: Target config /etc/calico/confd/config/bird.cfg has been updated due to change in key: /calico/bgp/v1/host

    bird: BGP: Unexpected connect from unknown address 10.250.12.180 (port 60008)
    ```

## Describe Pods
I checked the Pod on the control plane with `describe`:
```sh
kubectl describe pods -n calico-system calico-node-gw7h4
```

Something was wrong here:
```
[...]
calico/node is not ready: BIRD is not ready: BGP not established with 10.4.0.1
[...]
```

This Pod gave me a bit of a different message. It happned to be the control plane. According to the message above the IP address is wrong:
```sh
kubectl describe pods -n calico-system calico-node-hksbf
```

Something was wrong here:
```
[...]
calico/node is not ready: BIRD is not ready: BGP not established with 10.250.12.185,10.250.12.186,10.250.12.187
[...]
```

## Check that nodes
Check that nodes listen to port TCP/179 with the command:
```sh
sudo ss -tunlp | grep 179
```

Output of `ss`:
```
tcp   LISTEN 0      8            0.0.0.0:179        0.0.0.0:*    users:(("bird",pid=479605,fd=7))             
```

>Use `sudo` as it will give you a bit more information


```sh
sudo lsof -nP -iTCP:179 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

Output of `lsof`:
```
COMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE   DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
bird    479605 root    7u  IPv4 41993722      0t0  TCP *:179 (LISTEN)
```

## BIRD peering config
Check the BIRD peering config that Calico has generated, to see if it is using the IPs that you intend:
```sh
kubectl exec calico-node-hksbf -n calico-system cat /etc/calico/confd/config/bird.cfg
```

Didn't seemed right for the `control-plane`. The source should have been `10.250.12.180`
```
[...]
router id 10.4.0.1;
[...]
# For peer /bgp/v1/host/s666dan4051/ip_addr_v4
# Skipping ourselves (10.4.0.1)
[...]
```

## How to Change the Default Setting for `nodeAddressAutodetectionV4` in Calico
Validate current install settings for `nodeAddressAutodetectionV4` with the command:
```sh
kubectl get installations default -o yaml
```

```
[...]
spec:
    nodeAddressAutodetectionV4:
      firstFound: true
[...]
status:
      nodeAddressAutodetectionV4:
        firstFound: true
[...]
```

Get all the nodes:
```sh
sudo -E calicoctl get node
```

Output:
```
NAME          
s666dan4051   
s666dan4151   
s666dan4152   
s666dan4153   
```

Check the control plane node for the BGP IP address:
```sh
sudo -E calicoctl get node s666dan4051 -o yaml
```

In the output below, we see that the address `10.4.0.1/24` is wrong:
```
spec:
  addresses:
  - address: 10.4.0.1/24
    type: CalicoNodeIP
  - address: 10.250.12.180
    type: InternalIP
  bgp:
    ipv4Address: 10.4.0.1/24
```

We need to modify the Calico Operator Installation with the command:
```sh
kubectl edit installation default
```

Modify the `nodeAddressAutodetectionV4` for `kubernetes: NodeInternalIP`. The command above is opens the configuration file in `vi`. Your configuration should look like the one below. Replace the line `firstFound: true` with `kubernetes: NodeInternalIP`:

```
spec:
[...]
    multiInterfaceMode: None
    nodeAddressAutodetectionV4:
    # The following also worked for me since my interface is 'ens160'
      # interface: ens.*
      kubernetes: NodeInternalIP
[...]
```

>After saving the file (:wq), you should see the all the Pods `calico-node-xxxx` restarting. When it's done, check the BGP peering. Be patient, in could take up to 1-2 minutes ðŸ˜€

```sh
kubectl set env daemonset/calico-node -n calico-system --list | grep IP_AUTODETECTION_METHOD
```

Output as expected:
```
IP_AUTODETECTION_METHOD=kubernetes-internal-ip
```

## Verification
Check the BGP peer status with the command:
```sh
sudo kubectl calico node status
```

In my case, the modification fixed my problem, see the output:
```
Calico process is running.

IPv6 BGP status

```

Check the control plane node for the BGP IP address:
```sh
sudo -E calicoctl get node s666dan4051 -o yaml
```

In the output below, we see that the address `10.4.0.1/24` has been replaced by the real interface IP:
```
spec:
  addresses:
  - address: 10.250.12.180/24
    type: CalicoNodeIP
  - address: 10.250.12.180
    type: InternalIP
  bgp:
    ipv4Address: 10.250.12.180/24
```


Check the logs of the Pods. You shouldn't see anymore error messages:
```sh
kubectl logs -f --tail=15 --namespace=calico-system calico-node-bhjqf
```

You can also check BIRDâ€™s running state, as regards establishing those peerings:
```sh
kubectl exec calico-node-6d8lc -n calico-system -- birdcl -s /var/run/calico/bird.ctl show protocols all
```

This is a lengthy output:
```
